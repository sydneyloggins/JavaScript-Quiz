# Javascript Quiz

## Description
This is a JavaScript quiz incorporating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript techniques. The motivation behind this project is to learn how to build a small quiz game from scratch utilizing the DOM; I build this project to grasp a better understanding of JavaScript and how it interacts with HTML/CSS. I learned how to create a quiz game from scratch using past techniques from other modules and added the JavaScript component.
